            <h3><em> Synopsis of Matthew Martinez </em> </h3>
            <ol> 
            <li> I hope there’s a grain of wisdom that just one person can take from this.  I’m a student who took what you might call the “road less traveled” even though that statement is far from being its normal connotation, rather it is more like the fork in the road where anyone with half a brain would follow the right path. By no means do I think I am special, I have unique qualities, yes, but I’ve found that my ability to network has granted me opportunities I at times was undeserving of. For example, this past summer a couple friends and I formed a real estate LLC that we put all our energy into.  That was a “high roller” lifestyle, which got the best of us.  It’s one of those things you can only reflect on in retrospect.  But first let me back up.  I’ve lived in Pittstown, NJ my entire life where everyone knows everyone I excelled in school and sports even receiving the scholar athlete award upon graduating middle school. Straight As were required, as well as performing well in sports.  I still can’t pinpoint how things began to go wrong, so I no longer bother trying to backtrack through the painful memories.  Things quickly went south.  I found myself in jail my senior year of school and graduated by the grace of my dear friend and former soccer coach, Steven Delorenzo, who went to extreme lengths to help me graduate with my class.  Fast forward to 2018, and I met the girl of my dreams (still on probation) and she encouraged me to stay strong for the last year of my PTI so not to mess it up for myself and face the felony charges that were pending for my stupidity.  Dating her just felt so natural and we didn’t even have to speak words to know what each other was thinking…this is where it gets deep.  She struggled with her own abusive family problems which never seemed to be resolved, or even acknowledged.  The one morning January 13, 2021, I lost her to an overdose, which sent me on such a spiral that the milky way galaxy would envy it.  I gave up all hope after my whole world disintegrated.  Heartbroken, lost, hopeless, and suicidal I was clueless of how I could continue after such a loss.  I still had my friends, but it’s one of those situations where they didn’t (and honestly never could have) understand how to help me.  That whole year following is a blur, and I numbed every sensation in any way available.  Blowing thousands of dollars to “buy false joy”, behaving recklessly to intentionally ruin myself without remorse, burning every bridge I built with others, and disregarding my closest friends. I can tell you that’s NOT the answer.  The answer is still yet to surface, but here I am typing about one of my most personal experiences and getting the words out even when they may be difficult to say is the only one true thing that can keep you sane.  Mental health in men is so important, and since I have gotten sober, I’ve even had a friend from my previous real estate company reach out to me for advice and support on sobriety.  I don’t know why I am still here. Yes, I am religious, but it’s hard to trust in something that can truly bring you to your knees in agony leaving a gaping hole in you.  But solipsism has allotted me the comfort I require when I ask too big of questions. All I can do is take care of myself until I am well enough to help others.  Its like Donnie Darko laughing at the end of the movie even though he knows he’s about to die.  If time travel were real, I know where I would be, though it isn’t, so I must remain hopeful that all the pain in the world, not just my own, isn’t in vain.  Taking each day as a fresh start, or even smaller, every minute is for that matter relevant.  Not knowing what’s to come has taught me that we need to live more in the moment in the chaos.  We are not God, and nor are we his puppets.  We are people, and as Mac Miller once said before his untimely passing “your life ain’t a life till you live it”. My dad’s change of heart after surviving Vietnam challenges that thought perfectly.  Why shouldn’t you fill life with experiences you might never have the time to try?  We are here for some reason yes, but its easier to fill that existence with reason, rather than search aimlessly for it.  So as a twenty-three-year-old student who still lacks an associate degree but has thousands of ideas of ways to make it in this world, I leave you with this.  Never tell yourself you can’t do or try something.  If someone is going to laugh, that is their problem.  The more we embrace our own freedom to be ourselves, the less we have pent up inside what can at times be a destructive place.  So have at it and live yours.  </li>

            <h3><em> My Hobbies </em> </h3>


                <ul>
                <li> Over my life many hobbies have come and gone, although some surely stuck.  Music is one of them.  I used to listen to CD’s in the car with my dad, we would go to Barnes and Nobles and pick something out.  As I grew older, I got into EDM, and now I am into rap and rock and roll.  My favorite part of listening to music Is playing the albums on vinyl, since I am a self-proclaimed audiophile, I own shelves worth of both new and old music ranging from an OG 1973 copy of Dark Side of the Moon to some newer pressings by other artists which sell for upwards of $300 (not for sale) but my next turntable is already picked out so it’s only a matter of time before I’m back at having two which is super convenient.  Another hobby of mine is exploring the parks NJ has to offer, whether it be on foot, bike, or bouldering (where it is legal of course) since many people have died falling off rocks doing such activities.  Fishing with my dad is another huge one, really anything we do together is enjoyable. We just remodeled our bathroom, and we did it together, so I learn a lot just by helping (even though a lot of it is me doing, not just observing).  Other hobbies include shooting pool since I am lucky enough to have one in my house which my friends and I surely take advantage of all hours of the night, collecting rare vinyl pressings, super smash bros melee (and ONLY MELEE), traveling to cool restaurants and chess. Recently my friend has got me into making music, so we will see where that goes.  Sometimes my friends who race will take me to the track and since he’s cool with the owners, they let me ride passenger which is a feeling unlike any other. I also love to thrift and look for neat vintage apparel.  Since music is a hobby of mine, I too enjoy setting up sound systems for optimal sound quality/ambiance.  I also love staying up late writing essays and listening to birds chirp as I type away.  Did I mention I have the coolest cat in the world?  </li>

            <h2>A brief exerpt from Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde </h2>

            <div>
                <p>Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.</p>

                <p>No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted.</p>
                
                <p>It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.</p>
