            <h3><em> Synopsis of Matthew Martinez </em> </h3>
            <ol> 
            <li> I hope there’s a grain of wisdom that just one person can take from this.  I’m a student who took what you might call the “road less traveled” even though that statement is far from being its normal connotation, rather it is more like the fork in the road where anyone with half a brain would follow the right path. By no means do I think I am special, I have unique qualities, yes, but I’ve found that my ability to network has granted me opportunities I at times was undeserving of. For example, this past summer a couple friends and I formed a real estate LLC that we put all our energy into.  That was a “high roller” lifestyle, which got the best of us.  It’s one of those things you can only reflect on in retrospect.  But first let me back up.  I’ve lived in Pittstown, NJ my entire life where everyone knows everyone I excelled in school and sports even receiving the scholar athlete award upon graduating middle school. Straight As were required, as well as performing well in sports.  I still can’t pinpoint how things began to go wrong, so I no longer bother trying to backtrack through the painful memories.  Things quickly went south.  I found myself in jail my senior year of school and graduated by the grace of my dear friend and former soccer coach, Steven Delorenzo, who went to extreme lengths to help me graduate with my class.  Fast forward to 2018, and I met the girl of my dreams (still on probation) and she encouraged me to stay strong for the last year of my PTI so not to mess it up for myself and face the felony charges that were pending for my stupidity.  Dating her just felt so natural and we didn’t even have to speak words to know what each other was thinking…this is where it gets deep.  She struggled with her own abusive family problems which never seemed to be resolved, or even acknowledged.  The one morning January 13, 2021, I lost her to an overdose, which sent me on such a spiral that the milky way galaxy would envy it.  I gave up all hope after my whole world disintegrated.  Heartbroken, lost, hopeless, and suicidal I was clueless of how I could continue after such a loss.  I still had my friends, but it’s one of those situations where they didn’t (and honestly never could have) understand how to help me.  That whole year following is a blur, and I numbed every sensation in any way available.  Blowing thousands of dollars to “buy false joy”, behaving recklessly to intentionally ruin myself without remorse, burning every bridge I built with others, and disregarding my closest friends. I can tell you that’s NOT the answer.  The answer is still yet to surface, but here I am typing about one of my most personal experiences and getting the words out even when they may be difficult to say is the only one true thing that can keep you sane.  Mental health in men is so important, and since I have gotten sober, I’ve even had a friend from my previous real estate company reach out to me for advice and support on sobriety.  I don’t know why I am still here. Yes, I am religious, but it’s hard to trust in something that can truly bring you to your knees in agony leaving a gaping hole in you.  But solipsism has allotted me the comfort I require when I ask too big of questions. All I can do is take care of myself until I am well enough to help others.  Its like Donnie Darko laughing at the end of the movie even though he knows he’s about to die.  If time travel were real, I know where I would be, though it isn’t, so I must remain hopeful that all the pain in the world, not just my own, isn’t in vain.  Taking each day as a fresh start, or even smaller, every minute is for that matter relevant.  Not knowing what’s to come has taught me that we need to live more in the moment in the chaos.  We are not God, and nor are we his puppets.  We are people, and as Mac Miller once said before his untimely passing “your life ain’t a life till you live it”. My dad’s change of heart after surviving Vietnam challenges that thought perfectly.  Why shouldn’t you fill life with experiences you might never have the time to try?  We are here for some reason yes, but its easier to fill that existence with reason, rather than search aimlessly for it.  So as a twenty-three-year-old student who still lacks an associate degree but has thousands of ideas of ways to make it in this world, I leave you with this.  Never tell yourself you can’t do or try something.  If someone is going to laugh, that is their problem.  The more we embrace our own freedom to be ourselves, the less we have pent up inside what can at times be a destructive place.  So have at it and live yours.  </li>

            <h3><em> My Hobbies </em> </h3>


                <ul>
                <li> Over my life many hobbies have come and gone, although some surely stuck.  Music is one of them.  I used to listen to CD’s in the car with my dad, we would go to Barnes and Nobles and pick something out.  As I grew older, I got into EDM, and now I am into rap and rock and roll.  My favorite part of listening to music Is playing the albums on vinyl, since I am a self-proclaimed audiophile, I own shelves worth of both new and old music ranging from an OG 1973 copy of Dark Side of the Moon to some newer pressings by other artists which sell for upwards of $300 (not for sale) but my next turntable is already picked out so it’s only a matter of time before I’m back at having two which is super convenient.  Another hobby of mine is exploring the parks NJ has to offer, whether it be on foot, bike, or bouldering (where it is legal of course) since many people have died falling off rocks doing such activities.  Fishing with my dad is another huge one, really anything we do together is enjoyable. We just remodeled our bathroom, and we did it together, so I learn a lot just by helping (even though a lot of it is me doing, not just observing).  Other hobbies include shooting pool since I am lucky enough to have one in my house which my friends and I surely take advantage of all hours of the night, collecting rare vinyl pressings, super smash bros melee (and ONLY MELEE), traveling to cool restaurants and chess. Recently my friend has got me into making music, so we will see where that goes.  Sometimes my friends who race will take me to the track and since he’s cool with the owners, they let me ride passenger which is a feeling unlike any other. I also love to thrift and look for neat vintage apparel.  Since music is a hobby of mine, I too enjoy setting up sound systems for optimal sound quality/ambiance.  I also love staying up late writing essays and listening to birds chirp as I type away.  Did I mention I have the coolest cat in the world?  </li>

            <h2> Learn about Variable Fonts! </h2>

            <div>
                <p>Developers tend to use the term font and typeface interchangeably, however, there are unique distinctions between the two terms.  First off, a typeface refers to the underlying visual design which can take on multiple forms in typesetting technologies.  Contrarily, a font is just one of these such use cases when implemented in a digital file format. Simply put, what you see as the user is the typeface, and the font is what you use to write with.  Another common misconception that gets little attention is the difference between a style and a family.  The family is comprised of styles, which can be manipulated to effect stronger emphasis.  Style, however, is an individual typeface of the family font, such as bold italic, thin italic, regular, medium, and black italic to name a few. Developers and designers face constraints based on the inherit size of the layout or page they choose, as well as the colors that are applicable in these circumstances (the type of printing press, how modern it is, and its capabilities can limit the number or types of colors that can be utilized.  Typeface styles, on the other hand, can be used without any interference or accommodation.  This allows for aesthetic and rich print media which enhances and engages the reader. </p>

                <p>A major hindrance to the fonts and colors used comes down to the cost effectiveness, better known as bandwidth cost of these designs.  This is a reason why a magazine may be more expensive than another since the web designers and developers must follow these constraints.  In other words, richer typographic experiences are more costly, which drives the price of the material its printed on to go up. When working with traditional web fonts, when adding more styles to the design requires users to download a new unique font file, which results in slower processing and page rendering times. “Only including the Regular and bold styles, plus their italic counterparts can amount to 500 KB or more of font data.” The benefit of font families is that they offer a very wide array of styles to alter the appearance of the font such as for emphasis.   Styles such as Thin to Black weights, narrow and wide widths, difference font sizes large and small, and various other details to add style to your text. The fallback is that since every new font file must load individually, most web developers abstain from utilizing these features to benefit the reader or user. Variable fonts can have a major impact on the user experience, and ultimately help one decide whether a site is well built and trustworthy or not. The effort that goes into it can make a huge difference for the user. For example, you can use them for animations. Font weights can vary from one hundred to one thousand, which can also be animated, although bigger is not always better.  For one, they can be used to created great beautiful headlines.   But more importantly, variable font’s ability to enact subtle changes to text to reach the “goldilocks” thinness or thickness when working with fonts.  </p>
                
                <p>Effectively implementing variable fonts realistically be quite tricky.  Since a variable font is a singular font that can be manipulated to express many forms.  In the past, there was only seven percent support capability for variable fonts.  But with new updates in browsers such as Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge, all variable fonts are supported properly.  Today font variations are a viable technology, however, not all support from the browsers is equal. One example is the latest versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, macOS or iOS11+, you have extensive capability of font variations.  On the contrary, the capability and availability of variable fonts on the web is limited; very few commercially available variable web fonts are available.  This issue is being addressed such that the growing number of free and experimental variable web fonts are more recently listed and available to use.  </p>
